# Pennium Lab Notes

***

## Part One:

### 1a) Old Pennies:

> 30.8g (10)

> 3.1g (Average)

### 1b) New Pennies:

> 24.9g (10)

> 2.5g (Average)

### 1c) Prediction:

> 26.8g (Seven New, Three Old)

> 2.7g (Average)

### 1d) Seven New, Three Old:

> 26.6g (10)

> 2.7g (Average)

### 1e) Answer:

> The average mass is closer to the average mass of the new penny, because more new pennies were massed than old.

***

## Part Two:

### 2a) Six Old, Four New Prediction:

> 28.4g (10)

> 2.8g (Average)

### 2b) Six Old, Four New:

> 28.4g (10)

> 2.8g (Average)

### 2c) Answer:

> The average mass is barely closer to the average mass of the old penny, for the same reason stated above in part one.

***

## Part Three:

### 3a) Canister D:

> Canister D Empty: 5.6g

> Canister D Full: 35.6g

### 3b) Canister K:

> Canister K Empty: 6.4g

> Canister K Full: 36.4g

### 3c) Canister B:

>Canister B Empty: 5.8g

> Canister B Full: 31.9g

### 3d) Canister E:

> Canister E Empty: 5.8g

> Canister E Full: 33.0g

## Part Four:

### 4a) Canister D:

> Step Zero: 35.6 - 5.6 = 30, Subtract the mass of the empty can from the mass of the full can to get the mass of just the pennies, then set up the equation

> Step One: 3.1x + (10 - x) 2.5 = 30, Subtract 1x from 3.1x

> Step Two: 2.1x + (10) 2.5 = 30, Multiply 10 by 2.5

> Step Three: 2.1x + 25 = 30, Subtract 25 from 30

> Step Four: 2.1x = 5.1, Divide 5.1 by 2.1

> Step Five: x = ~2, 2 Old pennies

> Step Six: 10 - 2 = 8, Subtract 2 old pennies from the total to get the number of new pennies

### 4b) Canister K:

> Step Zero: 36.4 - 6.4 = 30, Repeat step zero from part 4a

> Step One: 3.1x + (10 - x) 2.5 = 30, Subtract 1x from 3.1x

> Step Two: 2.1x + (10) 2.5 = 30, Multiply 10 by 2.5

> Step Three: 2.1x + 25 = 30, Subtract 25 from 30

> Step Four: 2.1x = 5, Divide 5 by 2.1

> Step Five: x = ~2, 2 Old pennies

> Step Six: 10 - 2 = 8, Subtract 2 old pennies from the total to get the number of new pennies

### 4c) Canister B:

> Step Zero: 31.9 - 5.8 = 26.1, Repeat step zero from the previous sections

> Step One: 3.1x + (10 - x) 2.5 = 26.1, Subtract 1x from 3.1x

> Step Two: 2.1x + (10) 2.5 = 26.1, Multiply 10 by 2.5

> Step Three: 2.1x + 25 = 26.1, Subtract 25 from 26.1

> Step Four: 2.1x = 1.1, Divide 1.1 by 2.1

> Step Five: x = ~1, 1 Old penny

> Step Six: 10 - 1 = 9, Subtract one penny from the total to get the number of new pennies

### 4d) Canister E:

> Step Zero: 33 - 5.8 = 27.2, Repeat step zero from the previous sections

> Step One: 3.1x + (10 - x) 2.5 = 27.2, Subtract 1x from 3.1x

> Step Two: 2.1x + (10) 2.5 = 27.2, Multiply 10 by 2.5

> Step Three: 2.1x + 25 = 27.2, Subtract 25 from 27.2

> Step Four: 2.1x = 2.2, Divide 2.2 by 2.1

> Step Five: x = ~1, 1 Old penny

> Step Six: 10 - 1 = 9, Subtract one penny from the total to get the number of new pennies
